> "Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.
> Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.
> Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things." 

*— Douglas Adams*

This quote by Douglas Adams is not only true for technological innovation, but also for innovations in society.

But it's not that easy isn't it…

I remember very well how the level of progressiveness my generation had. There were clear movements and you saw how culture was changing because it was reasonable - even if we got mocked by older people of that time. It was funny how disconnected and firmly lost in their own past ways they were. 

But let's be real – today's generation is just going too far. The handouts they want, the privileges they demand, and the changes they push for. Some of the requests are absurdly irrelevant and small, mostly missing the point of what really matters in our world. And in some cases, they don't notice – due to arrogance or naivety – how some of their changes will lead to all kinds of problems. They just get played by bigger institutions. And if you dare to disagree you get branded as old and against society. This isn't progressiveness and it is just against the law of nature. Isn't it?

And it's not only society. It's also culture – the music we listened to was simply better than the crap now in the charts – wasn't it? Objectively speaking the production might not have been as flawless and many of the artists weren't really trained. But it just kicked differently, didn't it? The associations we have when listening to it, what this kind of culture meant to our generation, and how we lived and celebrated. Not the pop music of our time. The cool stuff we listened to before others did. Current music just doesn't hit the same way. It's shallow pop, cash-grabs and if it's not it's some weird edgy, or half-assed stuff. Isn't it?

The youth wants instant gratification and is glued to their devices. They are spoiled and addicted – and this causes all kinds of mental health problems. We were different. Yes, we watched TV all the time and played computer games every free second. We even laughed at how they said computer games cause violence and isolation. Older people didn't get it. But it was different. It was natural how we did it. It's different and unnatural how the current generation does it. Isn't it?

I mean i am not that old… the people younger than me are either kinda similar to me… or simply kids. The people older than me are borderline ancient though to be honest. So i think i can reflect here with objectivity. I mean let's be real. I am not turning more conservative as I am getting older. It's the progressive who are going crazier and crazier with the last generations. They have left me behind. Didn't they?

Jokes aside – i get it and what nobody told you… getting older is scary.

- In your late 20ties, you are a role model to the ones coming after you.
- In your late 30ties, you start noticing how the new generation does no longer agree with you on everything.
- In your 40ties, you start noticing how they don't care about your opinion and you self-isolate with peers who get you.
- In your 50ties, you realize how they don't care about you at all and your biggest fear becomes real. You become non-relevant, living in a world you no longer understand.
- And if you haven't built your legacy, you will be lucky if you die *before* you are forgotten.

If it's any recollection. This fear and disconnect between generations are as ancient as humanity itself. 

> “The children now love luxury; they have bad manners, contempt for authority; they show disrespect for elders and love chatter in place of exercise. Children are now tyrants, not the servants of their households. They no longer rise when elders enter the room. They contradict their parents, chatter before company, gobble up dainties at the table, cross their legs, and tyrannize their teachers.”

*― Socrates, ~400 BC*

And there isn't much you can do apart from being as open to new culture – and thoughts – as possible, all while being as self-reflective as you can.
