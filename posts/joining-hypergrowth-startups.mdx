I am writing this for a friend joining an early-stage breakout startup (year 2; $200M+ valuation). I wrote it as bullet points as it was meant to have an audience of one. He suggested that I share it here as well so that it is more widely available.

**About this format:** Normally, people write multiple paragraphs with stories and repeating examples to drive home “a point”. In contrast, the format of this blog post is a bit more “raw”. So please [feedback me](https://twitter.com/andreasklinger) and let me know what you think.

**Disclaimer:** The advice is meant for anyone joining the early stages of a hypergrowth team (15-150 people; multiplying in revenue, investments and/or headcount). Usually in the first 1-3 years of a startup. Most of the advice I would not give in larger, more established teams. I also did not try to sugarcoat nor glorify things. It’s just a download of my “recommendations” i would give in a 1on1 discussion.

As always: Everything is IMHO & YMMV. 🙏

## My advice to people joining hypergrowth startups

### Your mindset

#### Say; Do

- people rely on you; don’t drop; don’t backtrack
- before you make promises take time to think about stuff if needed
- speak up if there is an issue

#### Don’t think in “roles”; but understand problems and apply skills

- be the person everyone wants to ask to fix something
  - go in; fix/create/setup/improve; hire someone better; move to next
  - first in a weekly rhythm; then monthly; then quarterly; then yearly
- Example: In my first startup, the job title on my business card was “CWTFO” because my job was to establish or fix areas of the company.
  - In reality, every job in a fast-growing company is – with different degrees of variance – a CWTFO role.

#### Everyone is in every role interim

- the best early people will have ten defacto roles in 2 years
  - sometimes titles will sound lower; don’t worry
  - hire better people than yourself; find something else you are impactful in
- Example: Leaders should avoid throwing around titles but instead use comma titles
  - Instead of “Head of XYZ” – do “Operations Lead, XYZ”

### Solve problems

#### You are hired to fix problems; not to point them out

- most problems your company faces are not hard
  - there are just lots of them
- you are not hired to point them out but to solve them

#### A half-fixed problem is a not-fixed problem

- it’s easy to implement the 20% of the solution
  - don’t drop stuff there
- make sure stuff gets adequately finished either by you or someone else
  - it’s done when it’s solved
- Example: I frequently worked with people who were good at spotting problems, coming up with a solution, but then not pulling through.
  - You can barely reuse a 20% approach if the originator isn’t leading it. You start from scratch
  - Nobody is hired to “point out obvious solutions” - most problems we face are not that hard - just too many.

#### Have default solutions

- have a solution for every problem you bring
  - don’t hand over problems upwards
- bring solutions you want feedback on

### Stress and Chaos

#### Stuff is stressful

- but remember
  - stress is you losing control; not you working too much
  - you can burn out, barely working at all
- being overwhelmed is ok; temporary; if you can stay in control
- Example: managers frequently burn out people by letting them face the consequence of rapid changes without shared control over reasoning nor impact on them
- Example: when you feel stressed:
  - regain overview/control
  - or decrease boundaries of authority/responsibility

#### Build order and structures

- early stage can be chaos
  - bring process and structure
  - just as much as needed; not much more
  - improve as it’s needed later
- Example: Processes are not chains of bureaucracy.
  - They are expectations made explicit. It can be 1-step actions.
  - Processes allow you to scale as you don’t need to discuss continuously one-offs.

#### Stuff is urgent, important, critical, stressful

- know the differences and how/when to handle differently

#### stuff will go wrong; that’s normal

- risk mitigation is important
  - have paths to fix things
  - move forward
- compare the cost of waiting
  - to how much better
  - or less risky
  - the future solution most likely will be.
- Example: Can you revert your change? Can you avoid brand damage if it goes wrong? Is the potential damage manageable?
  - If yes: move forward

#### Your goal is not to work “a lot” but fast & effective

- extra work time won’t compensate for you not scaling yourself

#### Find ways to recharge

- family, sport, hobbies, passions
  - whatever works for you
- actively make time for those
  - fast-growing work and related problems will otherwise use up every crank of time you have
  - establish boundaries

### Scale your work

#### Never wait; never get stuck

- switch quickly between issues if stuff is stuck
  - make sure balls don’t get dropped
- never “wait”
  - consider if you can do a good-enough solution by yourself
  - consider what alternative thing is most impactful instead

#### Get autonomy through transparency

- be publicly transparent in what you will do
  - docs, posts, tasks, etc
- to make sure people don’t need to feel they need to check-in
  - it creates trust; this creates autonomy

#### Acknowledge sync; solve async

- people are nervous
- acknowledge stuff asap; even on the weekend (early on)
- do it async whenever you can fit it in unless urgent

#### Scale yourself

- automate
- hire
- empower

### Your Team

#### If you lead teams

- hand problems downwards in your team to share authority
  - but you are responsible
- every success is the success of people in the team
  - every fail yours
- treat people like adults
  - give them information
  - trust them to make decisions
  - trust them even if you feel they make mistakes
- ensure people have a fair setup
  - keep information and power differences in mind
- [Sidenote: Management advice will be a separate blogpost]

#### Hypergrowth teams compensate half-done products with effort

- no balls dropped when it comes to customers
- extra effort whenever possible
- early on, that’s required
  - later on, you want to establish process, automation, and solutions to avoid those one-offs

#### Differ between frustration with a situation and a person

- treat those separate
- by default, you are frustrated with the situation even if it doesn’t feel like it
  - typical exception: situations that happen repetitively

#### Your coworkers are not your therapists

- **never** load your stress on “people below you”
- **avoid** loading stress/frustration to people “beside” or “above you”
- telling/sharing is ok
  - but “handing over to solve” is typically useless
    - they don’t have the time nor competence
    - most likely, they just end up frustrated too
    - most likely, they do this the first time too
  - if you share also have a default solution to avoid “passing the burden”
- get a coach

### Your career

#### Do a tour of duty

- you won’t be there forever
  - people who fit in well early don’t fit well later unless they level up a lot into top management (most don’t)
  - most founders don’t want to work for large bureaucratic companies
  - so they “instead” end up creating large bureaucratic companies by themselves
  - but it’s a large company they have power in and can stay longer term
  - other early people not necessarily
- plan 1-3 years of a strong learning experience

#### Optimize for equity

- not because it’s worth more
  - that too
  - but because its easier to get a salary boost later on
  - equity increases are hard as the company valuation increases
- Disclaimer: This is only true for early-stage companies

#### Have fun

- don’t take yourself or anything else too serious
- never sacrifice long-term health
- never sacrifice family-time
  - you can’t get back, neither

I hope this is useful to others as well
