[@bgmasters](https://twitter.com/bgmasters) created an [awesome series of blog posts](http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup/) covering his notes of Peter Thiel’s startup class CS183\. Personally i try to read more on the kindle (in the park) and less in front of my laptop screen. Therefore i took the liberty to copy-paste them to word and convert them to a kindle-ready pdf.

It’s a bit messy - i didn’t know word is SO… well let’s not talk about it. I discovered in the end i could also done an have html for [calibre](https://href.li/?http://calibre-ebook.com/) to convert. I know… this would have been by far better, but well it’s already done :)

A few friends asked me to send them the link. To speed this up. Here is a public blogpost.

It would be great if you could follow [@bgmasters](https://twitter.com/bgmasters) as a quick thank you for his extra efforts to create those notes. To put the size of this lecture and @bgmasters effort into context: The PDF has 688 pages!

Here is the download to the PDF.

Edit: It seems unfortunately like @bgmasters [does not want](http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/post/22922727433/read-share-please-dont-transform-or-sell) his content to be re-distributed. That’s very sad but understandable from his point of view.

If you are still interested you in a pdf/kindle version you can ad-hoc create one [by using readlists](https://href.li/?http://bit.ly/thiel-readlist). (thanks to [mwsherman](https://href.li/?http://news.ycombinator.org/user?id=mwsherman) for noting!)
