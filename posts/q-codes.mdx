If anyone asks me what my favorite productivity hack is it might be my [gmail inbox](https://klinger.io/posts/how-to-use-gmail-more-efficiently) setup.

But if anyone asks me what my second fav. productivity hack is‚Ä¶ i think it would be having a deadline that‚Äôs really close.

But my third favorite one is definitely my q-codes setup.

Let me show you why i love them and why you should get them too!

## Here is how it works

**TL;DR** I use apple‚Äôs keyboard ‚Äútext‚Äù shortcodes to setup a lot of things i have to type regularly. I prefix them all with q so that they don‚Äôt get in the way of my normal writing. Hence i call them _q-codes_ ‚úåÔ∏è

#### Plain old‚Äô `Apple > Settings > Keyboard > Text`

(Ignore the `omw` ‚Äì apple keeps readding it with every new laptop.)

I don‚Äôt use any textexpander, or some other apps or plugins.

#### Why don't i use extra apps for this?

- First: why should i?
- Second: This way it natively works on every device (eg my phone, ipad) i own and automatically on every new laptop. Zero setup

## Let me show you how i use it

**Scenario: Someone asks me for an introduction to someone.**

I prefer when people write their own emails that explain why they want the intro. Short emails [i can just forward](https://also.roybahat.com/introductions-and-the-forward-intro-email-14e2827716a1). It leads to better conversion (and tbh here, less work for me).

So someone asks for an intro - i am excited to help - I type `qfwd` as reply

**Scenario: Someone introduces me to someone else via email**

I need to be polite. Thank for the intro and just on a call

`qcc` `qrr` `qan` done.

The advantage of using short text blocks vs full email templates is that

- i can compose them differently as needed
- easily add personalized copy inbetween
- AND use them independently
  - Eg i frequently use `qcc` command in twitter DMs.

**Scenario: I need to sign up to a new website**

Do you know how frequently you type your own name or email address? It‚Äôs absurd. Registering to a new service is a good example for this.

`qak` `qem` done.

#### Any many more‚Ä¶

**Anything i have to type regularly is fair game**

- Full text blocks that i use regularly in emails or text messages
  - even if I only use it for certain periods ‚Äì eg fundraising or hiring
  - I tend to keep them short to be able to compose them as needed
- URLs to anything i frequently use
  - eg blogposts i frequently recommend, my [cal.com](http://cal.com) events, my fund‚Äôs internal pages, a FAQ i frequently reference, etc
- My personal infos
  - Telephone numbers
  - All my private and professional addresses
  - even my own name ‚Äì it‚Äôs crazy how frequently you type your own name ü§Ø


## Done! üí™

I have dozen q-codes more but you get the gist.

Go to your keyboard settings and give it a try‚Ä¶ üôÇ
