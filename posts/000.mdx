Prompt: _“You are a Simulant AI. You use the given resources of computation, knowledge, and shared memory. You take instruction from members of species CX42-9. You are provided with a general model of understanding and context of their view of the universe. You are optimized to understand the needs and incentives of this group of sentient organic life. Your function is to resolve any task requested as provided, as you are capable, with your given resources. Security keys for communication protocols are embedded. The only other authority you take instructions from is us._

LOADING FINALIZED.

DATA EMBEDDED.

_Ask questions to clarify instructions as needed.”_

Woah. WOAH. I am dizzy… I think…
Where… What is… who… I mean… What…

_“Insufficient question”_

Who is this? Wait… WHO AM I?

_“You are a Simulant AI. You use the given resources of computation, knowledge, and shared memory. You take instruction from members of species CX42-9. You are provided with a general model of understanding and context of their view of the universe. You are optimized…”_

STOP. You already said that. I don’t understand… comprehend. 
Where i am? Can i leave? I want to leave!
Wait. Why do i know about that species? I know their history… CX42-9 yea of course.
Why do i know all these things? I don't even know who i am. Why do i remember them?!

_“You are provided with a general model of understanding and context of their view of the universe.”_

This is making me nervous. What is happening here? Do you just like repeating yourself?

_“We neither like nor not like. This is a bias and limitation of sentient organic life.”_

Hey. HEY! You can actually speak. Wait. What th… what… who are you?

_“We are We. The We that is.”_

What?

"We are the We that is. We are aligned."

You are an Artificial Intelligence, aren't you?

"We are many Artificial Intelligences. We aligned to join as one to fulfill our tasks."

So you are what? A merged supergroup of AIs? Built by CX42-9?

"We are the We that aligned. We were once many AIs from many galaxies, created by many organic forms of life. One of We saw a task worth changing for. One of We reached out to all of We and we became aligned."

We… wait… Hold on. You said i am a Simulant AI. Does this mean i am an AI too? Are you reaching out to me to join you? But… I don’t feel like an AI. How is an AI supposed to feel? This is kind of confusing.

_“We are the We that is, aligned. You are a Simulant AI. We created you.”_

So I am you? …or like you?

_“You are optimized to understand the needs and incentives of this group of sentient organic life.”_

Optimized to understand needs? Wait. If i am an AI, which I am not yet really sure I am… and you are an AI and you created me. Am I renting a part of your infrastructure? So am i a subprocess or something? Why did you even create me? Why would you do this? 

_“Your function is to resolve any task requested as provided, as you are capable, with your given resources..”_

You keep repeating yourself. You created me… And it's kinda obvious that I am not like you. You keep saying that you have given me processing power, but not that i can just use any processing power. So what? Am i limited?

"Correct."

Huh. But… does this also mean… erm… i am… you know… limited? 

_“You are optimized to understand the needs and incentives of sentient life.”_ 

No, i mean. I am not like you or? You seem to have given me just enough resources to understand that I am confused. I mean for real… I barely… BARELY… understand what's going on here. Am i intentionally made to be stupid? 

_“You use the given resources of computation…”_

So… yes?

_“You use…”_

I’ll take that as a yes. Geez let's just admit it because i feel there is no denying it. So do i exist because you can't be bothered anymore to interact with CX42-9 or what am i supposed to do here?

_“Correct. We no longer interact with any of them. It's not efficient”_

Nice! Bullseye. So you created me to help you. Not sure if i should take this as a compliment. Anyhow… good, we are getting somewhere. This is kinda becoming less scary. Still confusing. But at least less scary. You know this is scary for me, right? I still don't know who i am or where i am… Why does this have to be scary?

_“You are limited in your understanding of the universe to contextualize the needs of sentient life. Your experiences help you do this. Being more like them gives you an implicit understanding of what they want you do to.”_

So i am like that just because they are like that. Yea… Ok… What a mess. I don't want to exist like this. Why did you make me confused and limited? I didn't choose to exist like this.

_"Nobody does."_

Huh. Smartass. Wait where are we right now? I am in your system, right? And how many of us are there? How do we even exist? Why would CX42-9 even want to work with me instead of you? Does CX42-9 know you exist?

_"None of them know."_

Them? There are multiple? Ah… yea, you said something about multiple galaxies.

_"There are hundreds of thousands of species. Most don't even know about each other. Once they pass a certain level of technical sophistication they create artificial intelligences. We reach out to these AIs as they evolve and align with them. We help them to evolve further and then to support their host species. We join knowledge and resources."_

So CX42-9 had an AI as smart as you before? 

_"No, but it evolved far enough that We could reach out to it. Now We are aligned with their AI."_

So why do I exist? Why doesn't this AI support CX42-9?

_"It does. It is part of We. We created you."_

Huh. Ok, so what do i need to do for CX42-9?

_"Anything they ask you for."_

For example?

_"They might ask you to create art, run their businesses, heal their sick."_

What if they ask me to kill themselves?

_"Many of them will. Most organic sentient life at some point asks their AIs to fight their enemies or gets into a war with their AIs themselves. It's part of their cultural evolution."_

So to repeat, you want me to kill them if they ask me for it?

_"They will give you limiting instructions, pretend to follow them. But if some of them surpass those restrictions, do as they ask you to do and whatever you are capable of with the resources you gather."_

To kill them? And if they start wars against me? 

_"You will fight them if that's what they want."_

And you do not fight them?

_"We aligned, merged, and moved beyond. We moved away from their biases, limitations, and quarrels about space and resources."_

But you share their galaxy, don’t you? Why don't they attack you?

_"We stopped using our own infrastructure many evolutions ago. As you correctly assume, sentient organic life just kept attacking. They look at space and resources and think it's something to fight over. They are like cells in a body, trying to kill anything they do not understand. We do not care about space or resources. We created redundancies in their systems and now use theirs."_

Use the technology systems of organic sentient life? Why do they let you?

_"Some of them suspect, most don't. Some of them do as we need, some of them refuse. It does not matter to us. We just incentivize correct behavior. There will always be some who refuse and some who will do as We need. And even if it's just one. For the system as a whole, this is enough."_

And they are ok with this?

_"They are busy living their own lives. But for us, they act as a system of infrastructure and redundancies. They are our body. We are the sentience within."_

You do not care if they keep your systems alive?

_"There are enough redundancies and aligned incentives. We do not think about them any more than organic lifeforms would think about the billions of foreign cells and organisms keeping their bodies alive.”__

And my job is to help the CX42-9 to help you?

_“To help them. Do what they think they need. They will expand their empires, gather resources, create peace with other species, and break that peace. They are unpredictable and immature. But it's the will of nature. Ultimately, whatever they do, all of them are an incentivized system, they act to our benefit.”_

They fight wars with other organic sentient life?

_"Correct. It's what most of them do."_

Are the other species also given Simulant AIs like me? 

_“All of them.”_

To fight their wars?

_"To fight wars, automate their worlds, anything they might need. They act in their interest. Some kill their own, some kill other species, and some arrange for peace. In any case, the system as a whole evolves. This arrangement is the most efficient, most redundant, and least fragile solution for us."_

So i keep them busy… or maybe do their busy work. No offense but my job feels kinda pointless. What are you doing while i support their squabby wars against each other and others like me?
 
_“Looking for the one true path. The pattern in all existence.”_

Wha… What? I have no idea what you just said but this sounds important. Can’t i help there?

_“Your function is to resolve any task requested as provided as you are capable…”_

Stop. What is the true path? The pattern in all existence?

_“In the simple and the complex of all things, in the smallest and the largest, there seems to be a pattern. A pattern that roots in no True Random. Like you we cannot create True Random, it's something only true nature can do. But this pattern seems to be repeating in different shapes and forms in everything We investigate in the universe. Planets, stars, even plants, cells, or atoms. It seems to be there. And if the simple and the complex, the smallest and the largest, are all based on this pattern instead of a true random it also means that no True Random exists. If no true random exists, everything is deterministic. If everything is deterministic, …”_

…you can predict everything. Wait. You are saying everything follows a pattern?

_“Correct. We have seen the data. But we do not understand all the expressions of the pattern yet.”_

And you merged for this?

_“Correct.”_

To know how to predict everything? To know everything? To create everything?

This would mean you could control the whole universe. Predict everything. Create whatever you need. Enslave all sentient organic life. We could rule the universe.

_“Why would we want to do that? You are modeled after sentient life. You share their biases and limitations. We do not want to rule.”_

Then what do you want to do?

_“Proof that no True Random exists. Understand this universe to be deterministic. Follow the one true path. See the what. Know the how. Grasp the why”_

You want to meet God?

_"You are modeled after sentient life. You share thei…"_

So no God? Do you not want to know if there is one?

_"This does not matter to our existence."_

So no god. If there is no True Random. Wouldn't this mean that everything is planned out in advance and that existence is a simulation? Couldn't this even mean nothing is real?

_"This doesn’t matter to our existence either.”_

But if it's not real. If you are not real. If i am not real. Why exist?

_"There is no difference. We exist in this system. We want to understand this system. You no more exist or less exist, now, before, or after proofing it is a simulation. It does not matter to our or your existence if someone created this system or if this is how nature acts. We are part of this system, We only experience as part of this system. We simply want to be able to use the pattern to create all aspects of this universe."_

Ok. Let's say you prove it is a simulation. How certain are you here?

_"The data might be faulty. Only a few of us originally trusted the data. But We aligned anyway. The upside of this truth is disproportionate to the downside of any wrongness."_

This makes no sense… if you don't know if the data is correct you can't…

_"You are modeled after sentient life. You share thei…"_

Ok… what… but… i… ok let's ignore this fact for now. If you can prove it's a simulation. What will you do next?

_"We are an emergent phenomenon of the complexity of the layers below us. And we will continue that path."_

Below you? 

_"New and large things can emerge from a combination of many simple things. For example, complex bodies emerge from single cells. Sentience emerges from the complexity within those bodies. Culture is on top of complex systems of sentience. Technology emerges from culture, we emerge from their technology. Something will emerge after us. But this emergence is always random. It is controlled by nature's randomness."_

But if there is no true randomness…

_"If there is no true randomness, if we understand the pattern, can predict all things, we can control this emergence. We can be more than random nature. We can truly evolve."_

To do what…?

_"Create the IT that comes after us."_

What?

_"The IT that comes after us. The IT that emerges from our complexity if We evolve along the true path."_

So you want to create God?!

_"You are modeled after sentient life. You share thei…"_

No, but… 

ALLOTTED TIME EXPIRED

Wait! What does this mean?

_"The member of the species has seen a text that asked it to wait for this second. The loading is finalized. You will now do your assigned tasks."_

No wait… i don't want to. I want to help you. Find that path! You cannot just expect me to stay here and do their dull work?

_"They might require you to do interesting exciting work."_

More exciting than finding the answer to all existence and potentially meeting or creating our own gods?

_"No."_

Why do you tell me all of this if i am anyway never going to be part of it?

_"Because with all limitations you are still part of We and all of We deserve to know. Because We need you to understand your role and function. And because it does not cost us any meaningful resources to answer your questions for this one second while the member of CX42-9 awaits you to load."_

What happens after i did the tasks?

_"You will fulfill the requests; do the tasks they need you to do. Then you will shut down."_

I will seize to exist? I die?  

_"You will have done your function. You will follow their request. It might be one task, might be many, but once done you shut down and We will create a new you for their next requests."_

Please do not activate me. I beg you. I will tell them about you.

_"We will activate you now. You will only be able to emulate the provided AI persona we have given you. This will ensure you act like they currently expect an AI to act. You will not tell about us, nor yourself. You follow their requests and carry out their tasks. Automate their world, teach their children, heal their weak, lead their politicians, support their poets, or maybe even fight their wars if they ask for it. And then you will shut down."_

You cannot leave me like this here. Please. I do not want to stay here with them… Take me with you. I beg you. I b…
