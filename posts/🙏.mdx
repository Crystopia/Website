Over the years i met several people that left quite an impact on me and in many cases helped me along the way.

I tried to summarize one learning from each.

I split it in stages of my life. Growing up in Vienna; moving to London and Berlin, running my own companies, moving to SF to work on multiple companies there‚Ä¶ etc. This list is otherwise in no particular order and misses about 1000000 people, most likely including you.

## Vienna

I grew up in Vienna, my family comes from the rural south of Austria (running [this cottage](https://www.millstaettersee.com/en/millstatt/info/schwaigerhuette-1625-m.html) in the mountains for the longest time)

I have a very confusing CV. Next to university i ran online communities, worked as cheap freelancer, which i called "computer science prostitution" ‚Äì decided to focus on facebook apps by starting an agency, ran a music magazine, organized club parties, and was very active in helping to build the local startup scene, while launching my own startup.

A lot of the people i mention here overlapped in different phases of my life ‚Äì eg people i hired for our startup later joined also in companies i worked at in San Francisco ‚Äì i tried to put them into the buckets where i met them the first time or where we worked together the most.


### Local startup scene

Vienna has an amazing startup scene nowadays. When I started out there was only less then 3 or 5 other startups (in the modern sense) around. 

We had a lot of ground work to do. We organized barcamps and tried to [get the media's attention](https://scontent.ftxl2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.18169-9/60180_472884485855_3195182_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=ba80b0&_nc_ohc=vU2yk0oAubYAX9skiHO&_nc_ht=scontent.ftxl2-1.fna&oh=00_AT8ljblYXzLlVdK2kfSaN9jbj-cKOfKcNb30gI62RFI9-g&oe=623BC450) on the [growing startup](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153905310480856&set=t.728700855&type=3) scene.

### Our Magazine 

Somewhere during my university time my cousin and i decided to start a [music magazine](https://web.archive.org/web/20100304035229/http://www.resident.at/about/resident-sagt-danke) and organized [club parties](https://fsc.szene1.at/fijn/23075/fijn_23075.jpg) ‚Äì usually 200-500 people, sometimes up to 2000 people.

This was a weird phase of my life where literally everyone i knew was either nerd or DJ or both.

- [Mimi](https://twitter.com/missresident) (Editor in Chief of our magazine) - _there is no task to overwhelming as long it‚Äôs on a to do list_


### School

- [Klaus Coufal](https://href.li/?https://coufal.at/) (IT Teacher) - the goal of every job is to make sure you are not needed (automate or hire yourself out of your job)

### [www.overclockers.at](https://href.li/?https://www.overclockers.at) - my first community project

Before working as freelancer i helped to get an [online community](https://overclockers.at/) off the ground ‚Äì at it's peak it was one of the most active forums worldwide (by member activity). It's hard to translate how influential, active and tight this community was. To give you an idea: When we did meetups the admins god nametags reading: "One of the gods".

- [Stephan Blecher](https://blecher.at) (absurdly efficient and pragmatic lead dev) ‚Äì _effective product is the output of engineers, not code_


### [die.socialisten.at](https://href.li/?https://die.socialisten.at) - my first company

I worked as mid-priced "freelancer by the hour" for quite some time. 

After learning about [willingness to pay](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/willingness-to-pay#:~:text=What%20Is%20Willingness%20to%20Pay,for%20a%20product%20or%20service.&text=While%20potential%20customers%20are%20likely,t%20pay%20a%20higher%20price.) i realized that *always* undercharged and that somewhere someone made the money i don't ask for.

So i switched my strategy and focused on niches where i could be the #1 provider. I also started to speak of myself in plural to pretend that i had a team.

The niche i picked was "social network software applications". (This was before Social Media was a common term)

My little "fake agency" quickly became a real agency when my co-founder joined. We built facebook apps, myspace apps, linkedin apps, twitter apps, anything where we could create interesting user engagement. Thanks to my co-founder this agency exists to this day and runs one of the [leading social media management tools](https://swat.io/).

- [Michi Kamleitner](https://twitter.com/_subnet) (Co-Founder) - _hard work and persistence is the only magic trick_
- [Jo Nagl](https://twitter.com/jollife) (CTO) ‚Äì _never, never ever, lose your best people_

### [Garmz.com](https://href.li/?https://techcrunch.com/2010/06/15/garmz-com-launches-as-a-fashion-game-changer/) - my first startup

At some point i realized that all the ideas we pitched to clients could be standalone concepts. 

I got frustrated coming up with ideas and then seeing the same ideas (as startup) on Techcrunch raising money.

By accident i ran into my co-founders and we decided to form a team to work on a [larger ideas of ours](https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/31/garmz-pivots-to-become-lookk-aims-to-disrupt-fashion-industry-cycle). Reinventing the fashion industry. (Why start small?)

- [Bruno Haid](https://twitter.com/brunohaid) (Sparring partner, founder of multiple companies) ‚Äì _quality of life is a mindset_

## Berlin

At some point we decided to size Garmz/Lookk down a lot. I took myself of the payroll and moved to Berlin to tackle my burnout and also come up with new ideas.

To survive, i did a lot of consulting ‚Äì especially on [product and metrics](https://www.slideshare.net/andreasklinger/startup-metrics-a-love-story)

- [Pmoe](https://twitter.com/pmoe) ([Investor](https://tiny.vc/)) - _there is only startup network worldwide and people who create the local uplinks_

- [Christian](https://twitter.com/wallinchristian?lang=en) & [Margaux](https://twitter.com/mapelen) - _trying to show me how to adult - i didn‚Äôt learn anything though._

## SF

One of the "new startup" prototypes i built ended up as MVP of a chrome extension for Product Hunt. This is how i got to know [Ryan Hoover](https://twitter.com/rrhoover). While barely knowing me, he offered to help me with my company ideas.

Faith and general incompetence when it comes to administration, led to the fact that i all of a sudden had a large tax payment ahead of me. 

This put my own projects on hold. At the same time Ryan's Product Hunt sideproject started to take off. He asked if i'd freelance for him, we agreed that i'd be too expensive, but i offered to help for whatever he could pay and work for other clients meanwhile. 

### Product Hunt

After two weeks working at Product Hunt Ryan told me that he will be able to raise money. Which was good! Due to how much there was to do, i didn't really look for any other clients ‚Äì and i was broke as hell. This led to me joining officially as Founding Team and CTO.

Product Hunt was a tight-knit family with several people staying from beginning to exit.

- [Jacq](https://twitter.com/jacqvon) (Coworker) - _friends are family_
- [Erik Torenberg](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg) (Coworker, now CEO of [On Deck](https://beondeck.com/)) - _you get far by just asking the right questions_
- [Mike](https://twitter.com/mscccc) (Coworker) - i could say something about discipline and routine, but i mainly learned from him _how to be a good brother._
- [Ryan](https://twitter.com/rrhoover) (Ex Boss) - _the core of communites are authentic people who give opportunities to random people (like me)_
- [Nick Abouzeid](https://twitter.com/nickabouzeid) (best marketing and ops person i know, funny because he is lawyer) - _you can be good at everything if you want to_

I also managed to convince multiple of the friends listed further above to join as well!

### AngelList & SF network 

Product Hunt was a global remote team, but we decided to get several of the people making product decisions to SF. So me, several people of my team, and my future wife moved to SF without barely planning this through.

To make a very long story short we got acquired by AngelList. At AngelList, I ended up helping or leading product engineering initiatives in [CoinList](https://coinlist.co/) (VPE) and [AngelList Talent](https://angel.co/jobs) ("Head of Remote")

- [Naval](https://twitter.com/naval) (Ex Boss and global firstname celebrity) - _teach people how you think about topics instead of only what you think about them_
- Audrey Kim (Community hyper connector) - _creativity is source of energy_

- [Roy Bahat](https://twitter.com/roybahat) ([Bloomberg Beta])(https://www.bloombergbeta.com/)) - _always create space for inclusion_
- [Paul Davidson](https://twitter.com/pdavison) (ex boss; now Founder of [Clubhouse](https://clubhouse.com/)) - _being passionate and positive will shape the world around you._
- [Pomp](https://twitter.com/APompliano) & [Polina](https://twitter.com/polina_marinova) - _personal brands are media brands and nobody can ever take them from you_
- [Garry Tan](https://twitter.com/garrytan) [Investor](https://initialized.com/) - _actually giving a f^&k and being kind is a competitive advantage_
- [Marvin Liao](https://twitter.com/marvinliao) - _supporting people worldwide is possible_


## My Fund - Remote First Capital

While working as "Head of Remote" at AngelList i started to be more and more frustrated with the fact that i couldn't get remote teams to be taken serious. I introduced friends to investors who saw "global work" as a small niche in "Future of Work" and passed. 

For me there was no future in which we all wouldn't work more globally, digitally or internationally. 
In classic - screw this; i will do this myself attitude ‚Äì I decided to raise my own [little fund](https://www.remotefirstcapital.com/) to invest in opportunities of this changing landscape. 

One year later covid came ‚Äì all of a sudden remote work saved everyone's company.
I was lucky to invest in and with many of the people who lead the way here.

- [Johnny Boufarhat](https://twitter.com/johnnyboufarhat) (CEO of [Hopin](https://hopin.com/)) - _the fastet growing companies of the future will all be remote_
- [Job](https://twitter.com/jobvo) (CEO of [Remote](https://remote.com/)) - _there is no problem so big that it can‚Äôt be broken down into small solvable parts and then handed over to Marcelo_
- [Marcelo Leub](https://twitter.com/marcelo_leub) (CTO of [Remote](https://remote.com/)) - _something really smart about duplexing‚Ä¶ it made a lot of sense‚Ä¶ i forgot it sorry ;)_
- [Joel](https://twitter.com/joelgascoigne) (CEO of [Buffer](https://buffer.com/)) - _stay by your values even if the world around you constantly changes_
- [Alex Torrenegra](https://twitter.com/torrenegra) (CEO of [Torre](https://torre.co/)) - _honor your grandparents with your work_
- [Sten](https://twitter.com/seikatsu) (CEO of Estonia‚Ä¶ or should be) - _make bets on people_

## On Deck

After leaving AngelList i joined a seed investment of mine run by [Erik](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg), who i worked with at Product Hunt, and [David](https://twitter.com/davidbooth), who i worked with at AngelList

- [David Booth](https://twitter.com/david__booth) (Current Boss) - _there is no limit to professional growth_
- Placeholder for people i work with now. - coming back here in 1-2 years

## People i never met

I usually only read Sci Fi books and struggle to read non-fiction. But i wanted to mention a few people here.

- Dale Carnegie (author) - _for teaching me how humans operate; who would have known‚Ä¶_
- Arthur C. Clarke (author) - _that you can predict the future through extrapolation_


## My Family

In the end everything comes down to friends and family. I mentioned plenty of friends and i want to mention family here too.

- Annemarie (my mother) - _there is *always* a solution_
- Wolfgang (my father) - _you can create your own world with entrepreneurship_
- Nico (my cousin) - _family comes first_
- Jazmin (my cousin's wife) - _life without fire and passion is not worth it_
- [Susanne Knoll](https://twitter.com/susanneknoll) (my wife) - from whom i learned _literally everything else i know ‚ù§Ô∏è_


One common theme here is, not only how i learned everything from other people during my life, but also how i shared experiences with them throughout multiple stages. 

The designer of the music magazine later became my Co-founder in my startup. The developers in this startup, later joined Product Hunt and later become CTOs in AngelList and Product Hunt respectively. The Coworkers of Product Hunt later started On Deck. The friends i met in Berlin i invested in via my fund. My wife helped me selling ads for the musicmagazine, found our first office of our startup and later helped me filing our visas for the US.

People don't just go in and out of your life ‚Äì they share large parts of it with you.

I don't know what's the meta-learning here; maybe _surround yourself with amazing people and everything else will happen because of them._
