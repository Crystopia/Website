Hello @everyone,

Finally, version 2.3.0 is here, and I can tell you what's new!

Update overview:

- New blocks | New block types for stone and others | 2.2.9 |
- Workflow | All servers are now on GitHub for better development | 2.3.0 |
- Resourcepack Host | Our resource pack is now even smaller and tidied up | 2.2.4 |
- Green House | New buildings on the server | 2.2.8 |
- Internal Updates and Fixes | Many bugs fixed, and versions updated | 2.2.2 |

Now, let me explain the workflow improvement. We can now create Dev Servers and Local Servers faster and easier because we now pull our files. This solves problems like updating files on different servers.

Development continues, and we will focus on building and UI, including prefix/permissions and GUIs, all designed uniformly.

Until the next update!

- Your Crystopia Team!
