**HEY HOO, we've got some great new stuff again, which this time is a bit visual. First of all, we now have:**

**🔗 Crystopia.link**  
- This domain is for all links etc like https://crystopia.link/discord

**🎨 New UI Update**  
- A new UI update came to the server today. We changed something in the tab and scoreboard to make everything a bit nicer.

**🐞 Bug fixes**  
- We have fixed bugs related to joining and loading the resource pack.  
- You should no longer be kicked when loading the pack.  
- The “missing prompt” bug should also be fixed.  
- Fixed the OnlyUp timer stopping when using commands.

**📝 Future updates**  
- The first gamemode and the Craft Attack event are now fast approaching.  
- However, there will also be a break during which we will have some time off.  
- After that we will continue with new updates such as the SMP.

You can see what's happening right now in [**#👀╎spoiler**](https://crystopia.link/discord), including the new features. But opening a game doesn't mean we're done...
